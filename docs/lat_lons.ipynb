    "# Working with lat-lon coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections we have considered grid point positions `coords` given as Cartesian coordinates. However, it is common that we have coordinates given as latitudes and longitudes. This notebook describes how we can constuct graphs directly using lat-lon coordinates. This is achieved by specifying the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of `coords` and the CRS that the graph construction should be carried out in. `coords` will then be projected to this new CRS before any calculations are carried out."

    "For our example above, let's instead try to construct the graph based on first projecting our lat-lon coordinates to another CRS with 2-dimensional cartesian coordinates. This can be done by giving the `coords_crs` and `graph_crs` arguments to the graph creation functions. Theses arguments should both be instances of `pyproj.crs.CRS` ([pyproj docs.](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/crs/crs.html#pyproj.crs.CRS)). Nicely, they can be `cartopy.crs.CRS`, which provides easy ways to specify such CRSs. For more advanced use cases a `pyproj.crs.CRS` can be specified directly. See [the cartopy documentation](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/reference/projections.html) for a list of readily available CRSs to use for projecting the coordinates. \n",

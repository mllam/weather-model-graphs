    "# Working with lat-lon coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections we have considered grid point positions `coords` given as euclidean coordinates. However, it is common that we have coordinates given as latitudes and longitudes. This notebooks describes how we can constuct graphs directly using lat-lon coordinates. This is achieved by also providing a specific projection, used to project the lat-lons to a euclidean space where the graph can be construced."

    "> *this section provides an introduction to what graph-based data-driven weather models are and how they work. Inline code using `weather-model-graphs` is used to demonstrate different parts of the graph*\n",
    "\n",
    "Current graph-based weather models use the [encode-process-decode paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261) on [message-passing graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212) to do the auto-regressive temporal prediction of the atmospheric weather state to produce a weather forecast. \n",
    "The graphs are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with the nodes representing features (physical variables) at a given location in space and the edges representing flow of information.\n",
    "The encode-process-decode paradigm is a three-step process that involves encoding the input data into a latent space, processing the latent space to make predictions, and decoding the predictions to produce the output data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The graph nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the nomenclature of [Lam et al 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12794) the nodes in `weather-model-graphs` are split into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **grid nodes**: representing the physical variables of the atmospheric state at a specific `(x,y)` coordinate in the (input) initial state to the model and the (output) prediction of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mesh nodes**: representing the latent space of the model at specific `(x,y)` coordinate in the intermediate (latent) representation of the model"

These coordinates are used to create the **grid nodes** nodes of the graph, with a node for each `(x,y)` coordinate.\n",

    "The edges between the **grid nodes** and the **mesh nodes** represent the encoding of the physical variables into the latent space of the model, while the edges between the **mesh nodes** represent the processing of the latent space through the time evolution of the atmospheric state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the complete message-passing graph consists of three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **grid-to-mesh** (`g2m`): the encoding compenent, where edges represent the encoding of physical variables into the latent space of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mesh-to-mesh** (`m2m`): the processing component, where edges represent information flow between nodes updating the latent presentation at mesh nodes through the time evolution of the atmospheric state\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mesh-to-grid** (`m2g`): the decoding component, where edges represent the decoding of the latent space back into physical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, the **mesh-to-grid** and **grid-to-mesh** updates can probably also encode some of the time evolution processing, in addition to the latent space encoding/decoding, unless the GNN is trained specifically as an auto-encoder using the same graph as input and output."

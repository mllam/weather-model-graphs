def create_single_level_2d_mesh_graph(xy, nx, ny):
    """
    Create directed graph with nx * ny nodes representing a 2D grid with
    positions spanning the range of xy coordinate values (first dimension
    is assumed to be x and y coordinate values respectively). Each nodes is
    connected to its eight nearest neighbours, both horizontally, vertically
    and diagonally as directed edges (which means that the graph contains two
    edges between each pair of connected nodes).

    The nodes contain a "pos" attribute with the x and y
    coordinates of the node, and an "type" attribute with the
    type of the node (i.e. "mesh" for mesh nodes).

    The edges contain a "len" attribute with the length of the edge
    and a "vdiff" attribute with the vector difference between the
    nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xy : np.ndarray [2, M, N]
        Grid point coordinates, with first dimension representing
        x and y coordinates respectively. M and N are the number
        of grid points in the y and x direction respectively
    nx : int
        Number of nodes in x direction
    ny : int
        Number of nodes in y direction

"""
Generic routines for creating the graph components used in the message-passing
graph, and for connecting nodes across these component graphs.

The graph components, grid-to-mesh (g2m), mesh-to-mesh (m2m) and mesh-to-grid (m2g), are
used to represent the encode-process-decode steps respectively. These are created with
`create_all_graph_components` which takes the following arguments. Internally, this
function uses `connect_nodes_across_graphs` to connect nodes across the component graphs.

    Create all graph components used in creating the message-passing graph,
        grid-to-mesh (g2m), mesh-to-mesh (m2m) and mesh-to-grid (m2g),
    representing the encode-process-decode respectively.

    For each graph component, the method for connecting nodes across graphs
    should be specified (with the `*_connectivity` arguments, e.g. `m2g_connectivity`).
    And the method-specific arguments should be passed as keyword arguments using
    the `*_connectivity_kwargs` arguments (e.g. `m2g_connectivity_kwargs`).

    The following methods are available for connecting nodes across graphs:

    g2m_connectivity:
    - "nearest_neighbour": Find the nearest neighbour in grid for each node in mesh
    - "nearest_neighbours": Find the `max_num_neighbours` nearest neighbours in grid for each node in mesh
    - "within_radius": Find all neighbours in grid within an absolute distance
        of `max_dist` or relative distance of `rel_max_dist` from each node in mesh

    m2m_connectivity:
    - "flat": Create a single-level 2D mesh graph with `mesh_node_distance`,
        similar to Keisler et al. (2022)
    - "flat_multiscale": Create a flat multiscale mesh graph with `max_num_levels`,
        `mesh_node_distance` and `level_refinement_factor`,
        similar to GraphCast, Lam et al. (2023)
    - "hierarchical": Create a hierarchical mesh graph with `max_num_levels`,
        `mesh_node_distance` and `level_refinement_factor`,
        similar to Oskarsson et al. (2023)

    m2g_connectivity:
    - "nearest_neighbour": Find the nearest neighbour in mesh for each node in grid
    - "nearest_neighbours": Find the `max_num_neighbours` nearest neighbours in mesh for each node in grid
    - "within_radius": Find all neighbours in mesh within an absolute distance
        of `max_dist` or relative distance of `rel_max_dist` from each node in grid
    - "containing_rectangle": For each grid node, find the rectangle with 4 mesh nodes as corners
        such that the grid node is contained within it. Connect these 4 (or less along edges)
        mesh nodes to the grid node.

    `projection` should either be a cartopy.crs.CRS or None. This is the projection
    instance used to transform given lat-lon coords to in-projection Cartesian coordinates.
    If None the coords are assumed to already be Cartesian.

"""
Generic routines for creating the graph components used in the message-passing
graph, and for connecting nodes across these component graphs.

The graph components, grid-to-mesh (g2m), mesh-to-mesh (m2m) and mesh-to-grid (m2g), are
used to represent the encode-process-decode steps respectively. These are created with
`create_all_graph_components` which takes the following arguments. Internally, this
function uses `connect_nodes_across_graphs` to connect nodes across the component graphs.

    Create all graph components used in creating the message-passing graph,
        grid-to-mesh (g2m), mesh-to-mesh (m2m) and mesh-to-grid (m2g),
    representing the encode-process-decode respectively.

    For each graph component, the method for connecting nodes across graphs
    should be specified (with the `*_connectivity` arguments, e.g. `m2g_connectivity`).
    And the method-specific arguments should be passed as keyword arguments using
    the `*_connectivity_kwargs` arguments (e.g. `m2g_connectivity_kwargs`).

    The following methods are available for connecting nodes across graphs:

    g2m_connectivity:
    - "nearest_neighbour": Find the nearest neighbour in grid for each node in mesh
    - "nearest_neighbours": Find the `max_num_neighbours` nearest neighbours in grid for each node in mesh
    - "within_radius": Find all neighbours in grid within an absolute distance
        of `max_dist` or relative distance of `rel_max_dist` from each node in mesh

    m2m_connectivity:
    - "flat": Create a single-level 2D mesh graph with `mesh_node_distance`,
        similar to Keisler et al. (2022)
    - "flat_multiscale": Create a flat multiscale mesh graph with `max_num_levels`,
        `mesh_node_distance` and `level_refinement_factor`,
        similar to GraphCast, Lam et al. (2023)
    - "hierarchical": Create a hierarchical mesh graph with `max_num_levels`,
        `mesh_node_distance` and `level_refinement_factor`,
        similar to Oskarsson et al. (2023)

    m2g_connectivity:
    - "nearest_neighbour": Find the nearest neighbour in mesh for each node in grid
    - "nearest_neighbours": Find the `max_num_neighbours` nearest neighbours in mesh for each node in grid
    - "within_radius": Find all neighbours in mesh within an absolute distance
        of `max_dist` or relative distance of `rel_max_dist` from each node in grid
    - "containing_rectangle": For each grid node, find the rectangle with 4 mesh nodes as corners
        such that the grid node is contained within it. Connect these 4 (or less along edges)
        mesh nodes to the grid node.

    `coords_crs` and `graph_crs` should either be a pyproj.crs.CRS or None.
    Note that this includes a cartopy.crs.CRS. If both are given the coordinates
    will be transformed from their original Coordinate Reference System (`coords_crs`)
    to the CRS where the graph creation should take place (`graph_crs`).
    If any one of them is None the graph creation is carried out using the original coords.

    `decode_mask` should be an Iterable of booleans, masking which grid positions should be
    decoded to (included in the m2g subgraph), i.e. which positions should be output. It should have the same length as the number of
    grid position coordinates given in `coords`.  The mask being set to True means that corresponding
    grid nodes should be included in g2m. If `decode_mask=None` (default), all grid nodes are included.

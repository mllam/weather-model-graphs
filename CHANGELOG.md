## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/mllam/weather-model-graphs/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

First tagged release of `weather-model-graphs` which includes functionality to
create three graph archetypes (Keisler nearest-neighbour, GraphCast multi-range
and Oskarsson hierarchical graphs) deliniating the different connectivity
options, background on graph-based data-driven models, 2D plotting utilities,
JupyterBook based documentation. In this version the graph assumes grid
coordinates are Cartesian coordinates.
